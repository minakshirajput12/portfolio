        <h2>Hey there! I'm Minakshi Rajput</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my little corner of the web! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™m a web developer who loves to blend creativity with code to bring ideas to life. 
            Born and raised in the vibrant city of Pune, Maharashtra, Iâ€™ve always had a knack for technology and a passion for design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, but my true education has come from countless hours spent tinkering with 
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether itâ€™s crafting a sleek, responsive website or debugging a tricky piece of code, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me diving into the latest tech trends, participating in hackathons, or maybe just enjoying a good book with a cup of chai. 
            I believe that every problem has a solution â€“ sometimes it just takes a little bit of creativity (and a lot of coffee) to find it! â˜•
        </p>
        <p>
            Letâ€™s make something awesome together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
