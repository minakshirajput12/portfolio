                <h2>-: Calculator :-</h2>
                <p>I embarked on a coding adventure to create a snazzy calculator thatâ€™s as fun as it is functional! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a sleek and interactive calculator that makes crunching numbers a delight. With vibrant buttons and smooth animations, this calculator turns basic arithmetic into a playful experience. Whether you're adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing, each click brings a little joy, thanks to JavaScript magic behind the scenes. This project not only highlights my knack for turning code into cool tools but also adds a splash of creativity to the everyday task of calculating.</p>

                <h2>-: Swiggy website :-</h2>
                <p>I took on the challenge of recreating the Swiggy experience with React, turning my screen into a food delivery playground! This project dives into the dynamic world of React, showcasing its power to build a responsive and interactive Swiggy clone. From browsing menus to placing orders, every component is meticulously crafted to mirror the smooth, user-friendly interface Swiggy is known for. With state management and seamless UI, the app brings the excitement of food delivery right to your fingertips. This project highlights my ability to build complex, real-world applications while adding a flavorful twist to coding!</p>

                <h2>generate password</h2>
                <p> I built a robust password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users create strong, random passwords with ease. The sleek, user-friendly interface ensures a seamless experience, while JavaScript provides customizable options for security. This project showcases my ability to merge functionality with an engaging design for enhanced digital safety.</p>
